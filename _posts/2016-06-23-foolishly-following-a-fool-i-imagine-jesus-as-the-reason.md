## **Foolishly Following A Fool**

I imagine Jesus as the reason for all mankind. But His Holy wisdom is foolish to man---I must seem out of my mind.

For Christ's own family said He was mad, and a priest claimed a demon's to blame. So I in the form of an un-perfect man, must not appear perfectly sane.

I in my foolishness, once considered myself wise, but by offering The Fool, God opened my eyes. I in my weakness believe I am strong, but Christ endured the cross to show I am wrong.

I surrender that hunger to proclaim I am right, and He gives me the faith to receive. As His power of paradox opened my eyes, it blinds those who claim they have sight.

So lose your life for a carpenter's son---a madman who died for a dream. And you'll have the faith Christ's first followers had, and you'll experience the weight of the beam.

I foolishly follow a Fool, something only the foolish can see. I believe what the world says is unbelievable---why not come be foolish with me?
