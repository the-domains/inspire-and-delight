  “May God bless you with discomfort at easy answers, half truths, and
  superficial relationships, so that you may live deep within your heart. May
  God bless you with anger at injustice, oppression and exploitation of people,
  so that you may work for justice, freedom, and peace. May God bless you with
  tears to shed for those who suffer from pain, rejection, and starvation, so
  that you may reach out your hand to comfort them and to turn their pain into
  joy. And may God bless you with enough foolishness to believe that you can
  make a difference in this world, so that you can do what others claim cannot
  be done. May God bless you with the weirdest blessing possible—His divine
  burden.”  —Franciscan Blessing
