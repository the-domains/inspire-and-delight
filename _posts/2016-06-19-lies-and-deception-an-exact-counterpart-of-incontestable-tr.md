  Dear Christians, BE ENCOURAGED.  In all of my study of the Word of God of
  late, this study, and statement in general, rises as PURE GOLD, from my
  concordance study of John 8 - verses 38 through 47, tracing the difference
  between Jesus’s sentiments and the world’s (man) to a different rise and
  origin of what is “right” (or Truth).     The doctrine of Christ is not a
  plausible hypothesis, supported by probable arguments, but it is an exact
  counterpart of the incontestable truths lodged in the eternal mind.    In John
  8, two “fathers” are spoken of, according to the two families into which the
  sons of men are divided—God and the devil, and without controversy these are
  contrary the one to the other.    It is logical then, and supported in
  scripture, to be able to more easily understand how your fellow man (even
  Christians you know) are so easily deceived in these days of sorrow, as you
  begin to study the origin and lineage of these lies and deceptions.  As their
  doings were from hell: “You do that which you have seen with your father. You
  do, by your own works, father yourselves, for it is evident whom you resemble,
  and therefore easy to find out your origin.” As a child that is trained up
  with his father learns his father’s words and fashions, and grows like him by
  an affected imitation as well as by a natural image, so these Jews, by their
  malicious opposition to Christ and the gospel, made themselves as like the
  devil as if they had industriously set him before them for their pattern.  Be
  encouraged Christians. We already know God’s ways are not as our own, and we
  trust He is in complete control, so the lies and persecution we are faced with
  today, as was being told by the Jews in that day, is further encouragement of
  His coming.  Are you ready? Be alert!     “The Son of Man’s Arrival will be
  like that: Two men will be working in the field—one will be taken, one left
  behind; two women will be grinding at the mill—one will be taken, one left
  behind. So stay awake, alert. You have no idea what day your Master will show
  up. But you do know this: You know that if the homeowner had known what time
  of night the burglar would arrive, he would have been there with his dogs to
  prevent the break-in. Be vigilant just like that. You have no idea when the
  Son of Man is going to show up.   (Matthew 24:42-44 MSG)

# Lies and Deception: An exact counterpart of incontestable Truth 

Dear Christians, BE ENCOURAGED.   
In all of my study of the Word of God of late, this study, and statement in general, rises as PURE GOLD, from my concordance study of John 8 - verses 38 through 47, tracing the difference between Jesus's sentiments and the world's (man) to a different rise and origin of what is "right" (or Truth).   
  
The doctrine of Christ is not a plausible hypothesis, supported by probable arguments, but it is an exact counterpart of the incontestable truths lodged in the eternal mind.   
  
In John 8, two "fathers" are spoken of, according to the two families into which the sons of men are divided---God and the devil, and without controversy these are contrary the one to the other.   
  
It is logical then, and supported in scripture, to be able to more easily understand how your fellow man (even Christians you know) are so easily deceived in these days of sorrow, as you begin to study the origin and lineage of these lies and deceptions.   
As their doings were from hell: "You do that which you have seen with your father. You do, by your own works, father yourselves, for it is evident whom you resemble, and therefore easy to find out your origin." As a child that is trained up with his father learns his father's words and fashions, and grows like him by an affected imitation as well as by a natural image, so these Jews, by their malicious opposition to Christ and the gospel, made themselves as like the devil as if they had industriously set him before them for their pattern.   
Be encouraged Christians. We already know God's ways are not as our own, and we trust He is in complete control, so the lies and persecution we are faced with today, as was being told by the Jews in that day, is further encouragement of His coming.   
Are you ready? Be alert!
